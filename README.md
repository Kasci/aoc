# Advent of Code

This is the showcase of my solutions for the [AOC](https://adventofcode.com/).

Not all of the solutions are best in performance, most of the soluttions are coded to achieve the rapid development times. 

Primarily tasks are coded in Python as I started to learn Python with those tasks.
I also coded some tasks in C, as I wanted to get some more practice in the most used language.

I also plan to code in some lesser used languages, as Pascal, Fortran or Assembly Intel 8080, just as the example, that learning a new language is not a big issue.
